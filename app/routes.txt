Question	Answer
General Information		
What is BRTS System	Bhopal BRTS was a bus rapid transit system located in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India, funded by the Central Government under its flagship JnNURM program. Unlike most BRT projects in India designed to serve suburban areas, Bhopal BRTS primarily catered to the needs of the Central Business Districts (CBDs). It launched in 2006 with a fleet of just 30 buses, following the JnNURM sanction, and expanded to 225 buses, including both AC and non-AC low-floor models. However, on December 26, 2023, the Government of Madhya Pradesh, led by Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, decided to discontinue the BRTS project due to traffic issues caused by the corridor. Instead, a central road divider was planned to separate traffic between the two lanes. The process of dismantling the corridor began on January 20, 2024.
